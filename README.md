#### The user can also decide on the length of the password and even check the strength of his current one

### Technologies used:
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - SASS
 - JavaScript

### What I plan to add in the near future:
- registration system with the ability to store passwords in the database
- an algorithm that checks the breaking time of the given password
- general code refactoring
