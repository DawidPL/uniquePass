# uniquePass

Almost done.

This simple program will generate a password according to your preferences. All in one file, pure js. 
If you want to try just download index.html and .png files, that's it. 
Multiple choices of password strenght. Also allow user to enter type of numbers or letters he would like to have in. 

The Python file is this repository left after previous version when I was working on same project but in Python with Tkinter.
